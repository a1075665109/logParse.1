Project 2

For this project, compile it by first enter the command "make"
It then creates an executable called "logParse".
Running the project by calling "./logParse".
It could also be ran with these command line arguments "-h -i -o -t".

-h: displays all the avaliable command line arguments for this project.
-i: give a file name after -i to change its default input file from input.dat to the given file name.
-o: give a file name after -o to change its default output file from output.dat to the given file name.
-t: give a integer after -to change the dafault running time of the main program from 10s to given integer seconds.


Some problems I ran into while programming that took a long time to solve:
	 1. displaying the subset that goes in to the sum without fully understanding the algorithm.
	 2. file pointer manipulation, change in child process pointer does not carry back into parent.

Version control through github, all the logs could be found under log.txt within the directory.

There is a prepared input.dat file ready to use.
make clean command will remove only the executable and the default output file.
